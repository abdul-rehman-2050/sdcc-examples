7-Segment display
=================

Count on a 7 segment display approximately at a 1 Hz frequency.

### Hardware for this example
 - MCLR input pin must be connected to VDD.
 - A common cathode 7 segment display must be connected to PORTB. Common cathode connected to GND and anodes connected to the PIC pin through a ~1k ohm resistor each. Display segment A should be connected to RB0, segment B to RB1 and so on until segment G connected to RB6. [Seven-segment display](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display) on Wikipedia.

### Notes
 - Function `number_to_7_seg(...)` converts from an integer number to which segments must be on/off.
